#Credit Card Financial Dashboard

The Credit Card Financial Dashboard is a Power BI project designed to offer real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends within credit card operations. This dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor and analyse various aspects of credit card transactions, customer demographics, and revenue streams effectively. ￼ ￼

Business Problem

In the competitive financial services industry, understanding customer behaviour, transaction patterns, and revenue drivers is crucial for informed decision-making and strategic planning. Financial institutions require comprehensive tools to visualise and interpret complex data, facilitating the identification of trends, opportunities, and areas needing attention. The Credit Card Financial Dashboard addresses this need by providing an interactive platform to analyse and monitor credit card operations.

The dashboard integrates data from multiple sources to present a holistic view of credit card operations. Key features include: ￼
	•	Revenue Analysis: Tracks total revenue, annual fees, transaction amounts, and interest earned. ￼
	•	Customer Segmentation: Categorises customers by age, income groups, job types, and education levels to identify high-value segments. ￼
	•	Transaction Insights: Analyses transaction counts, amounts, and preferred channels (e.g., swipe, chip, online). ￼
	•	Geographic Analysis: Evaluates revenue contributions by regions and states, highlighting key markets.
	•	Card Performance: Assesses the performance of different credit card categories (e.g., Blue, Silver, Gold, Platinum) in terms of revenue and transaction volume. ￼

Key Metrics and Insights
	•	Overall Revenue and Transactions: The dashboard reveals total revenue over a specified period, with detailed breakdowns of transaction counts and amounts. ￼
