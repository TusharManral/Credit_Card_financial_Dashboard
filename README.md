# Credit Card Financial Dashboard

**Overview**

This project is a full-fledged Credit Card Financial Dashboard built using Power BI. It provides a comprehensive, data-driven view of customer behaviour, financial performance, and product usage across various dimensions. The dashboard is designed to help stakeholders monitor real-time metrics and make informed strategic decisions in the financial services domain.

The solution leverages DAX queries, clean visual storytelling, and structured analysis to convert raw transactional and customer data into valuable business insights.

**Business Problem**

Financial institutions often face challenges in gaining a holistic view of their customer base and financial operations. Key issues include:
	•	Fragmented reporting systems that delay decision-making.
	•	Difficulty in identifying which customer segments drive the most revenue.
	•	Limited visibility into delinquency risks, satisfaction trends, and product performance.
	•	Inability to compare financial metrics on a week-to-week basis.

This dashboard was created to solve these issues by consolidating key performance indicators (KPIs) and visual analytics into one unified platform.

⸻

**Objectives**
	•	Develop a real-time dashboard to monitor weekly credit card performance.
	•	Track customer demographics, income levels, card preferences, and regional behaviour.
	•	Measure overall revenue and its sources, including interest, annual fees, and transactions.
	•	Compare current and previous week's performance for trend analysis.
	•	Identify high-risk areas with delinquency data.
	•	Capture customer satisfaction scores to improve service delivery.

**Features**

Revenue and Performance Metrics

The dashboard tracks total revenue, breaking it down by:
	•	Transaction amounts
	•	Interest earned
	•	Annual fees collected

It allows week-over-week comparison using DAX measures to observe revenue fluctuations and operational trends.

**Customer Demographic Analysis**

The customer base is segmented across multiple dimensions:
	•	Age groups (20–30, 30–40, etc.)
	•	Income levels (Low, Medium, High)
	•	Gender, marital status, and education level

These segments help identify high-value customer profiles and tailor financial strategies accordingly.

**Product Insights**

Each credit card type—blue, Silver, Gold, and Platinum—is analyzed for its activation rate, revenue contribution, and customer usage patterns. The Blue and Silver cards are revealed as the most widely used, accounting for over 93% of all transactions.

Geographic Breakdown

The dashboard includes a state-wise analysis of performance. Texas, New York, and California stand out as the top contributors, together accounting for nearly 70% of the total revenue.

**Risk and Satisfaction Metrics**
	•	Delinquency Rate is tracked to assess financial risk exposure.
	•	Customer Satisfaction Score (out of 5) is used to evaluate service performance and customer engagement.

⸻

**DAX Highlights**

To drive dynamic metrics, the project uses a range of DAX formulas. Some of the key calculations include:
	•	Segmenting age and income groups using SWITCH(TRUE()) logic
	•	Creating weekly revenue comparisons with calculated measures for current and previous weeks
	•	Deriving total revenue by combining transaction amounts, fees, and interest

These DAX measures form the foundation for the visual analysis in the dashboard.

⸻

**Key Insights**
	•	Total revenue in 2023 was approximately $55 million
	•	Interest earnings contributed $8 million, while transaction amounts totaled $46 million
	•	Male customers generated slightly higher revenue compared to females
	•	Blue and Silver cards dominate the market with over 93.5% of transaction volume
	•	States like TX, NY, and CA lead in customer engagement and revenue contribution
	•	The activation rate for cards stands at 57.5%
	•	Delinquency rate observed is around 6%
	•	The average customer satisfaction score is 3.19 out of 5

**Project Files**

The project consists of multiple PDF reports that showcase the dashboard insights and analysis:
	•	Credit_Card_Financial_Weekly Dashboard Report – A weekly snapshot of key financial metrics
	•	Credit_Card_Customer Report – Deep dive into customer demographics and behaviour
	•	Credit_Card_Transaction Report – Focused view of transaction-level performance

All reports are designed for stakeholders to explore the data in a structured and meaningful way.

**Final Thoughts**

This project demonstrates how powerful data visualization and modelling can transform complex financial datasets into clear, actionable insights. By bridging the gap between raw data and strategic decision-making, the dashboard provides immense value to business users and analysts alike.
