# Credit Card Financial Dashboard

**Overview**

This project is a full-fledged Credit Card Financial Dashboard developed using Power BI. It offers a comprehensive, data-driven view of customer behaviour, financial performance, and product usage across multiple dimensions. The dashboard is designed to assist stakeholders in monitoring real-time metrics and making informed strategic decisions within the financial services sector.

The solution makes use of DAX queries, clear visual storytelling, and structured analysis to transform raw transactional and customer data into valuable business insights.

Business Problem

Financial institutions often struggle to gain a holistic view of their customer base and financial operations. Key challenges include:
• Fragmented reporting systems that delay decision-making
• Difficulty in identifying which customer segments generate the most revenue
• Limited visibility into delinquency risks, satisfaction trends, and product performance
	•	Inability to compare financial metrics on a week-to-week basis

This dashboard was developed to address these challenges by consolidating key performance indicators (KPIs) and visual analytics into one unified platform.

Objectives
	•	Develop a real-time dashboard to monitor weekly credit card performance
	•	Track customer demographics, income levels, card preferences, and regional behaviour
	•	Measure overall revenue and its sources, including interest, annual fees, and transactions
	•	Compare the current and previous week’s performance for trend analysis
	•	Identify high-risk areas using delinquency data
	•	Capture customer satisfaction scores to enhance service delivery

Features

Revenue and Performance Metrics

The dashboard tracks total revenue and breaks it down by:
	•	Transaction amounts
	•	Interest earned
	•	Annual fees collected

It allows for week-over-week comparisons using DAX measures, helping users identify revenue fluctuations and operational trends.

Customer Demographic Analysis

Customers are segmented across several dimensions:
	•	Age groups (20–30, 30–40, etc.)
	•	Income levels (Low, Medium, High)
	•	Gender, marital status, and education level

These segments help to identify high-value customer profiles and support the development of targeted financial strategies.

Product Insights

Each credit card type — Blue, Silver, Gold, and Platinum — is analysed for its activation rate, revenue contribution, and usage patterns. The Blue and Silver cards emerge as the most widely used, together accounting for over 93% of all transactions.

Geographic Breakdown

The dashboard includes a state-wise analysis of customer activity and revenue generation. Texas, New York, and California are the top contributors, collectively accounting for nearly 70% of total revenue.

Risk and Satisfaction Metrics
	•	Delinquency rate is tracked to assess financial risk exposure
	•	Customer satisfaction score (out of 5) is monitored to evaluate overall service performance and engagement

⸻

DAX Highlights

To enable dynamic and insightful analysis, several DAX calculations were implemented, including:
	•	Segmenting age and income groups using the SWITCH(TRUE()) logic
	•	Creating weekly revenue comparisons for both the current and previous weeks
	•	Calculating total revenue by combining transaction amounts, annual fees, and interest earned

These DAX measures form the analytical backbone of the dashboard.
